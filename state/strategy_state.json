      "strategy": "Based on the severe underperformance (-18.26%) of the previous \"Quality-Adjusted Earnings Momentum\" strategy—specifically driven by catastrophic drawdowns in individual holdings (e.g., -62% and -29%)—it is evident that fundamental quality metrics alone failed to filter out assets in severe technical decline.\n\nIn a \"Stable\" market, the strategy must pivot to prioritize **capital preservation and trend alignment** to avoid \"falling knives.\"\n\n**Refined Strategy Recommendation:**\n\n\"Adopt a **'Low-Volatility Trend-Value'** strategy. While retaining the core fundamental drivers of **Positive Earnings Revisions** and **Attractive Valuation** (Low P/E, P/B), immediately introduce a **Technical Trend Filter** (Price > 20-day or 60-day Moving Average) to disqualify stocks currently in a downtrend. Furthermore, apply a **Low Volatility** constraint (excluding stocks with extreme Beta or recent high variance) to align with the 'Stable' market signal and mitigate the idiosyncratic tail risk that caused recent heavy losses.\"",

      "strategy": "Based on the analysis of the recent performance divergence—specifically the success of the Feb 8th strategy (+5.64%) versus the volatility-induced failure of the Feb 9th strategy (-7.18%)—a refined approach is necessary.\n\n**Performance Analysis:**\n1.  **The Success (Feb 8):** The \"Catalyst-Driven Value\" approach worked because it targeted undervalued companies (Low P/B, P/E) with *actual* fundamental improvements (Earnings Revisions).\n2.  **The Failure (Feb 9):** The \"Earnings-Catalyst Value Reversion\" strategy failed due to a specific flaw in its technical entry criteria. By seeking \"Oversold (RSI < 45)\" assets without a strict enough volatility filter, the portfolio caught a \"falling knife\" (Stock 196170.KQ, -28.91%). In a \"Stable\" market, buying distressed assets introduces unnecessary idiosyncratic risk.\n\n**Refined Strategy Recommendation:**\n\n**Strategy Name: Quality-Anchored Value with Volatility Dampening**\n\n**Rationale:**\nTo capture the upside of the Feb 8th strategy while eliminating the tail risk seen on Feb 9th, we will maintain the **Value + Earnings** core but replace the \"Oversold\" entry signal with a **\"Price Stability\"** filter. We are seeking undervalued companies that are steadily climbing, not distressed assets hoping for a bounce.\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\n1.  **Fundamental Engine (Earnings & Profitability):** Continue to prioritize stocks with **Positive Earnings Revisions** and strict **Positive Net Income**. This ensures the business is growing, not shrinking.\n2.  **Valuation Guardrails:** Maintain focus on **Low P/E and Low P/B** to ensure a margin of safety.\n3.  **Risk Control (The Pivot):**\n    *   **Exclude High Volatility:** Filter out stocks with extreme recent standard deviation or those that have suffered a >10% drawdown in the last 5 trading days. We are avoiding \"falling knives.\"\n    *   **Technical Trend:** Instead of \"Oversold,\" look for **Neutral to Positive Momentum** (Price > 20-day Moving Average). We want assets participating in the \"Stable\" market trend, not fighting against it.\n4.  **Weighting:** Equal Weight (20%) to minimize single-stock impact.\n\n**Objective:** Generate consistent alpha through undervalued growers while strictly filtering out the downside volatility that caused the previous portfolio's drawdown.",

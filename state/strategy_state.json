The previous emphasis on general \"Financial Health\" and \"Volatility Management\" successfully preserved capital but lacked the specific drivers needed to generate distinct returns. Therefore, this refined strategy tightens the criteria to target high-quality companies with specific momentum drivers.\n\n**Strategy Dimensions:**\n\n1.  **High-Quality Cash Flow (Deep Fundamentals):**\n    *   Move beyond simple balance sheet strength. Prioritize companies with **improving Free Cash Flow (FCF)** and **high Return on Equity (ROE)**. In a stable market, companies that efficiently convert capital into cash are most likely to outperform.\n\n2.  **Valuation-Backed Growth:**\n    *   Refine the growth criteria to exclude speculative innovation. Focus on **\"Earnings Visibility\"**—companies where revenue growth is already materializing in quarterly reports. This ensures we are investing in proven execution rather than future promises.\n\n3.  **Momentum within Stability:**\n    *   While maintaining moderate volatility exposure, filter for stocks exhibiting **positive relative strength** (technical momentum) compared to the broader index. We seek \"quiet risers\"—stocks with low volatility but a consistent upward trend.\n\n4.  **Catalyst-Driven Sentiment:**\n    *   Shift news analysis from general monitoring to **Catalyst Identification**. Specifically look for positive sentiment clusters related to upcoming earnings, product launches, or strategic partnerships that can serve as a trigger for price appreciation in the coming week.\n\n**Target Allocation:**\nMaintain a balanced allocation (approx. 20% per holding) to mitigate idiosyncratic risk, but allow for overweighting if a stock scores highly on both **ROE** and **Sentiment Momentum**.", "selected": [{"stock_code": "095340.KQ", "weight": 40}, {"stock_code": "214150.KQ", "weight": 20}], "perf": 0.0}, {"date": "2026-02-08", "strategy": "Based on the historical performance data (consistently neutral at 0.0%) and the persistent **Stable** market signal, it appears that previous strategies—ranging from broad diversification to quality-growth—have been too defensive or passive to generate alpha. The recurring selection of `095340.KQ` across all portfolios suggests it is a high-quality anchor, but the surrounding selections have failed to contribute to gains.\n\nTo break this stagnation, the strategy must shift from \"Protection\" to \"Active Selection.\"\n\n**Refined Strategy Recommendation: Sentiment-Backed Momentum**\n\n**Rationale:**\nWith the market remaining **Stable** and past defensive/balanced strategies yielding flat returns, the focus must shift to identifying specific catalysts that drive price action independent of the broader market. We will pivot to a concentrated strategy that prioritizes **News Sentiment** and **Technical Momentum**, using financial health only as a safety filter rather than a primary selection driver.\n\n**Strategy Dimensions:**\n\n1.  **High-Impact News Sentiment (Primary Driver):**\n    *   **Focus:** Instead of general monitoring, prioritize stocks with **recent positive news spikes** (e.g., earnings beats, new contracts, or analyst upgrades). In a stable market, these idiosyncratic events are the strongest predictors of short-term price appreciation.\n    *   **Action:** Select stocks where sentiment scores are in the top quartile of the universe.\n\n2.  **Technical Relative Strength (Momentum):**\n    *   **Focus:** Filter for stocks exhibiting **positive relative strength** compared to the market index over the last 4 weeks. We seek stocks that are already trending upward, indicating institutional accumulation.\n    *   **Action:** Avoid \"bargain hunting\" for laggards. Invest in stocks trading above their 20-day moving average.\n\n3.  **Fundamental \"Safety Floor\":**\n    *   **Focus:** While deprioritizing deep value metrics, ensure candidates have **positive Operating Cash Flow**. This acts as a quality check to ensure the momentum is supported by business reality, not just speculation.\n    *   **Action:** Exclude companies with negative cash flow, regardless of sentiment.\n\n4.  **Concentrated Allocation:**\n    *   **Focus:** To move the needle on returns, reduce the number of low-conviction holdings.\n    *   **Action:** Allocate higher weights (20-30%) to the top 3 stocks that score highest on the intersection of Sentiment and Momentum, rather than equal-weighting a broad list.\n\n**Target Outcome:**\nConstruct a tighter, more aggressive portfolio that leverages the stable market backdrop to capitalize on specific stock stories and trends, aiming to break the streak of neutral performance.", "selected": [{"stock_code": "095340.KQ", "weight": 40}, {"stock_code": "083650.KQ", "weight": 30}], "perf": 0.0}]}

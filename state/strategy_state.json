      "strategy": "Based on the severe underperformance (-14.54%) of the previous \"Low-Volatility Trend-Value\" strategy—which failed to prevent catastrophic idiosyncratic losses (e.g., -61.97% and -28.91%)—it is clear that **valuation metrics (Low P/E, P/B) are currently acting as \"value traps,\"** selecting distressed assets rather than undervalued opportunities.\n\nIn a \"Stable\" market environment, the priority must shift from \"bargain hunting\" to **quality assurance** to eliminate tail risk.\n\n**Refined Strategy Recommendation:**\n\n**\"Quality-First Momentum with Strict Drawdown Control\"**\n\n1.  **Pivot from Value to Quality:** Replace Low P/B and P/E factors with **High ROE (Return on Equity)** and **Positive Operating Margins**. This ensures the portfolio holds companies with robust business models, significantly reducing the risk of sudden fundamental collapses (the -60% scenarios).\n2.  **Strengthened Trend Filter:** Maintain the **Price > 60-day Moving Average** rule but add a **Relative Strength** requirement (Stock performance > Market Index over 1 month) to ensure we are buying leaders, not laggards.\n3.  **Volatility Cap:** Exclude stocks with a **Beta > 1.5** or extreme recent daily variance to align with the \"Stable\" market signal.\n4.  **Risk Management:** Implement an **Equal Weighting** scheme (max 20% per position) to prevent single-stock disasters from dragging down the entire portfolio, as seen with the previous uneven weighting.",

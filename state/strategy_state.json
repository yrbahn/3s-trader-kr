      "strategy": "Based on the neutral performance (0.0%) of the previous allocation and the current \"Stable\" market signal, the strategy should shift from a pure \"Oversold/Value\" approach to a \"Quality/Momentum\" blend. In a stable market, low-quality undervalued stocks often stagnate (value traps), whereas companies with proven profitability and upward revisions tend to outperform.\n\n**Refined Strategy Recommendation:**\n\n\"Adopt a **'Quality-Adjusted Earnings Momentum'** strategy. Retain the core filter for **positive earnings revisions** and **attractive valuation** (Low P/E, P/B), but replace the 'oversold RSI' metric with a **profitability threshold (High ROE or Operating Margin)** to ensure asset quality in a stable environment. Reduce sector concentration (previously heavy in semiconductors) by selecting leaders across diverse industries that are demonstrating price stability or early trend reversal. Maintain a maximum weight of 20% per stock to manage idiosyncratic risk.\"",

      "strategy": "**Strategy Name:** Deep Value Mean-Reversion with Earnings Momentum\n\n**Rationale:**\nAnalysis of recent performance indicates that the \"Catalyst-Driven Value\" approach (Feb 8, +5.64%) significantly outperformed the \"Trend-Confirmation\" modification (Feb 9, 0.0%). In a stable market environment, buying undervalued assets with fundamental tailwinds during technical pullbacks proves superior to chasing established trends. Therefore, we will remove the moving average breakout requirement and re-emphasize mean reversion on fundamentally strong assets.\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\n1.  **Valuation:** Focus on Low P/E and Low P/B ratios (relative to sector) to ensure a margin of safety.\n2.  **Fundamental Catalyst:** Require **Positive Earnings Revisions** (1-month or 3-month) to identify companies with improving outlooks.\n3.  **Quality Floor:** Strict requirement for **Positive Net Income** to avoid distressed assets.\n4.  **Technical Entry:** Target **RSI (14) < 50**. This shifts focus from \"trend following\" back to \"buying value on dips/neutrality,\" aligning with the successful Feb 8 logic.\n5.  **Risk Management:** Maintain equal weighting (20% per stock) to mitigate idiosyncratic risk.",

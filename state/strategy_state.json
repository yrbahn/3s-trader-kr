Focus on undervalued stocks (low P/B, P/E) with upcoming catalysts identified through news sentiment analysis. Target oversold conditions (low RSI) for mean reversion. Enforce strict diversification (max 20% per stock) and require positive net income to mitigate risk. Aims to capitalize on price normalization driven by specific catalysts in fundamentally sound, undervalued assets.\n",

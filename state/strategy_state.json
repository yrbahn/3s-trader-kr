      "strategy": "Based on the sharp contrast in performance between the two recent strategies, a clear pivot is required.\n\n**Analysis of Performance:**\n1.  **The Failure (2026-02-09, -17.67%):** The \"Quality-First Momentum\" strategy failed catastrophically. By chasing \"High ROE\" and \"Relative Strength,\" the portfolio likely bought into overextended, crowded trades that unwound violently (evidenced by the -61.97% and -28.91% losses). In a \"Stable\" market, high-beta momentum plays introduced unacceptable idiosyncratic risk.\n2.  **The Success (2026-02-08, +5.64%):** The \"Catalyst-Driven Value\" strategy performed exceptionally well. It succeeded by combining **Value** (Low P/B, P/E) with **Fundamental Momentum** (Earnings Revisions) rather than Price Momentum. This approach captured upside while providing a valuation safety net.\n\n**Refined Strategy Recommendation:**\n\n**Strategy Name: Earnings-Catalyst Value Reversion**\n\n**Rationale:**\nTo replicate the success of the Feb 8th portfolio and eliminate the tail risk seen on Feb 9th, we will revert to a **valuation-anchored approach driven by fundamental updates**. We are abandoning \"Price Momentum\" (buying winners) in favor of \"Fundamental Momentum\" (buying improving companies) to avoid overvalued traps.\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\n1.  **Primary Catalyst (Earnings Revisions):** Prioritize stocks with **upward EPS estimates** or recent positive earnings surprises. This was the key differentiator in the successful portfolio.\n2.  **Valuation Safety Net:** Re-impose strict **Low P/E and Low P/B** limits. This ensures we are buying assets with a margin of safety, protecting against the massive drawdowns seen in \"High ROE\" growth stocks.\n3.  **Technical Entry (Mean Reversion):** Instead of buying breakouts (which failed), target **Oversold conditions (RSI < 45-50)** within a longer-term uptrend. We want to buy dips in fundamentally improving companies.\n4.  **Risk Control:** Exclude stocks with **extreme recent volatility** (Standard Deviation > Market Average) to avoid \"falling knives\" regardless of their theoretical quality.\n\n**Weighting:** Maintain **Equal Weighting (20%)** to mitigate single-stock risk.",

      "strategy": "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the performance divergence between the successful February 8th strategy (+5.64%) and the volatility-impacted February 9th strategy (-7.18%), here is the refined strategy recommendation.\n\n**Strategy Name: Quality Value Trend-Confirmation**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe historical data indicates that the \"Value + Earnings Revisions\" core is highly effective in the current \"Stable\" market environment (evidenced by the Feb 8th success). However, the Feb 9th drawdown was caused by a \"falling knife\" scenario (Stock 196170.KQ, -28.91%) where an \"Oversold\" signal was mistaken for a value entry. To correct this, we will retain the fundamental engine but replace the \"Oversold\" entry signal with a \"Trend Confirmation\" filter to ensure price stability.\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\n\n1.  **Fundamental Core (The Engine):**\n    *   **Earnings Momentum:** Prioritize stocks with **Positive Earnings Revisions** and **Positive Net Income**. (Retained from the successful Feb 8th strategy).\n    *   **Deep Value:** Target **Low P/E and Low P/B** ratios to ensure a margin of safety and upside potential.\n\n2.  **Risk Management (The Fix):**\n    *   **Volatility Filter:** Explicitly **exclude** stocks that have experienced a drawdown of >10% in the trailing 5 days or exhibit extreme standard deviation. This directly addresses the failure point of the Feb 9th portfolio.\n    *   **Trend Confirmation:** Replace \"Oversold RSI\" with a **Price > 20-day Moving Average** requirement. In a \"Stable\" market, we want to buy undervalued assets that have already begun their recovery, rather than guessing the bottom of a decline.\n\n3.  **Portfolio Construction:**\n    *   **Weighting:** Equal Weight (20% per stock) to mitigate single-stock idiosyncratic risk.\n\n**Objective:**\nTo capture the alpha generated by undervalued companies with improving fundamentals while strictly filtering out downside momentum and distressed assets.",

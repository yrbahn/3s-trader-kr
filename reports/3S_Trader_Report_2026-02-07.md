**Selection Strategy:**

In the current slightly bearish market characterized by high volatility, especially within the tech sector, the stock selection strategy should focus on the following dimensions to mitigate risk and identify growth opportunities:

1. **Financial Health**: Prioritize stocks with strong balance sheets and healthy cash flows to ensure stability and minimize the risk of financial distress during volatile periods.
   
2. **Growth Potential**: Identify companies with robust growth prospects, particularly those offering innovative products or services that can capture market share despite broader market challenges.

3. **Volatility Risk**: Actively manage and limit exposure to high volatility stocks, especially within the tech sector, to protect the portfolio from significant market swings.

4. **News Sentiment and Impact**: Monitor news sentiment and its potential impact on stock prices to uncover opportunities and risks that may not be immediately apparent in financial metrics.

By emphasizing these dimensions, the strategy aims to build a resilient portfolio capable of withstanding market fluctuations while positioning for future growth.

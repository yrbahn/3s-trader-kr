## 🧠 1. Strategy (Adaptive Strategy)
In the current slightly bearish market with high volatility in the tech sector, a strategic approach to stock selection should prioritize the following dimensions to mitigate risk and identify growth opportunities:

1. **Financial Health**: Prioritize stocks with strong balance sheets and healthy cash flows. This ensures stability during volatile periods and reduces the risk of financial distress.

2. **Growth Potential**: Focus on companies with robust growth prospects, particularly those with innovative products or services that can capture market share despite broader market challenges.

3. **Volatility Risk**: Actively manage and mitigate exposure to high volatility stocks, especially in the tech sector, to protect the portfolio from significant swings.

By emphasizing these dimensions, the strategy aims to construct a resilient portfolio capable of withstanding market fluctuations while positioning for future growth.
